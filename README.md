# Reactive Rails with no Javascript

![tutorial image](images/tutorial.png)

**About**

It is time to cast the long-teased new magic by DHH & Co. and learn to use **Hotwire** beyond 5-minute tutorials. The umbrella name behind libraries for building modern web interfaces seemingly without any effort or JavaScript is on everyone’s lips since the big unveil this year. 

The **HTML-over-the-wire** approach is making ripples through the Rails universe: countless blog posts, reddits, screencasts, and five RailsConf talks this year, including the one by yours truly, are dedicated to it. Here, I want to take more space to explain **Hotwire** thoroughly—with code examples and testing strategies. As my favorite rock band would say, let’s get Hotwired to… self-destruct learn new tricks!
